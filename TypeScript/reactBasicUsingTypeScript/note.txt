// Basic type
number // not Number->Number class
string
boolean 
null and undefined we dont normally used to assign type

Example:
let value:number = 4
let str:string = "n"
let isValid = true


// Complex type 
array
object

Example:
let name = ["ab","qw"]

//assgining object
let person : {   // not =
    name:string;
    age:number;
}


person = {
    name :"Max",
    age:45
}

person ={
    name:7 //will give error
}

// Type inference
const val = "string"


val = 32 // will give error through we didn't menetioned the type that is because
// typescript using type inference will take the type of the varible as the initial assigned value
